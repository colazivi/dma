Installing DMA:
===============

On most systems (with a development environment installed) you should be able to compile DMA with:
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Once it has been successfully compiled, you can install it with:
    make install
    
	If traditional sendmail links are desired (beware of existing mailwrapper or update-alternatives configurations!):
	make sendmail-link mailq-link

	If the directories in /var are missing:
	make install-spool-dirs

Troubleshooting:
----------------

Check that you have the following commands installed:
* cmake - minimum version 3.4 required
* cc - gcc is known to work
* lex - flex is known to work
* yacc - bison is known to work
* sh - Needs to be POSIX compliant, dash, bash known to work
* openssl
